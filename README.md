Pizza ordering website

Project 1  Forms & Redirection  
A key part of building your final year projects are creating apps that require user input and redirection.  This assignment should be completed individually.
You are going to be creating a pizza ordering system. The steps are
A user creates an account on your webapp
The are then presented with a page showing all their previous orders and a link to create a new order
They are then redirected to a page where they are asked to create a pizza
They are then redirected to another page asking them to fill out
Their name
address
payment info
After entering all information they are then presented with a final page showing the details of their order including
The address and date/time of the delivery
Details on the pizza they ordered, size, toppings etc‚Ä¶
Create pizza page
On the create pizza page a user should be able to
Select the size of the pizza they want (small, medium, large etc..)
Select the pizza crust type (normal, thin, thick, gluten free etc..)
Select the pizza sauce (tomato, bbq etc..) 
Select the cheese (Mozzarella, Vegan , Low fat etc..) 
Select from the following toppings (you can add more , but these have to be there at minimum):
Pepperoni
Chicken
Ham
Pineapple
Peppers
Mushrooms
Onions
Delivery details page
Once they are finished building their pizza they should be able to click a button called ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù , here they are taken to the order page where they will be asked for
Their name
Their address
Their card number
Their card expiry date (Month, Year) 
Their card cvv
üö®
The information on this page should be validated i.e. no blank expiration date, no blank Number etc.. https://data-flair.training/blogs/django-forms-handling-and-validation/
If the form is completed without errors they will be redirected to another page confirming that their order is complete and show them the pizza they just created. 
Finally, an admin using the django admininterface should be able to:
Create new pizza sizes
Add new types of cheese
Add new types of sauces
Steps
Get into your groups and start to plan your app, think about
What models do we have (what needs to get stored in the database)? 
What are the pages of the app
Each page needs a template 
Each page needs its own path in urls.py 
Each pathneeds its own view in views.py 
What forms are needed in forms.py - what are their rules? 
What is the design of our app , header/footer - remember to install bootstrap and check what components you can use to help make the app 
Styling
You should use bootstrap (or any other css framework of your choice) and style your page marks will be awarded for student who demonstrate use of components and invest time into the styling of their webpage 
Hints & Tips
Model & form design are the key to this app
A list of all model data types can be found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields/
All forms should be ModelForms
For toppings, initially you should think of them as checkboxes , this would mean they are ‚ÄúBooleanFields‚Äù in models.py
Submission
For your assignment you are to submit the following:
One zip file on loop containing the following
A link to a recorded video of you demonstrating your app (inside a .txt file)
Your project code
This project is worth 15% of your overall grade
Video demonstration
For the video demonstration it is required that you use your microphone. In the video you should show the code and explain the following:
Your Models.py file- what are the models you created and how do they link together
Your urls.py file, explain the links you have created and where the are used 
The files forms.py and views.py , explain how the forms are linked to your views, and where in the views.py you use different forms
The structure of your templates files (html)
In addition you should walk through the functionality of the application showing the following:
Creating a new order 
Checking out 
The order complete page
There is no set limit on the video duration, however I would recommend between 5-10 minutes.
